Alfie Zhang - 10/3/22, Sprint 2 - BoomerangAttackBehavior.cs - written by Hayden Gray

This class is able to handle weapons/projectiles that are seperate from a character (as in they are are different sprites). Any other Behavior classes written in this
way will be convenient to implement since you can assign different behaviors/weapons/projectiles to different characters; the IAttackBehavior pattern is very reusable. 
Can probably be used for bosses as well.

The class is relatively new, but some methods are unclear, such as NoWeapon(), which in the code assigns a none type to a variable called boomerang, which was a little
unituitive.
