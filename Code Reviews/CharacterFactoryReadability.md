Josh Long - 10/3/22, Sprint 2 - CharacterFactory.cs - written by Alfie Zhang

There are many medium-sized chunks of text within this class, but everything is very readable for the most part. One thing I like is the various comments throughout the code - this helps me instantly understand what's happening at certain points in the code. Most of the methods are also short in length, and more easily readable as a result.

The one thing in this class that is far less readable than everything else is the body of the GetCharacter() method. This is due to a switch statement containing many cases, one for each character type. However, seeing as each case does need to be handled appropriately, I'm not sure what more could be done about this to improve its readability. Although it's not the most readable thing in the code, it's actually not even that bad and is definitely a justified part of the code.
