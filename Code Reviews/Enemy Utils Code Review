Alfie Zhang - 10/3/22, Sprint 2 - EnemyUtils.cs - written by Hayden Gray

This utility class has good readbility; enums and dictionaries are clear and simple, and methods that manipulate vectors have very clear descriptions which also
explain the params and returns of each method.

It may be useful to make this a general utiliy class outside of the enemy directory to be used for other types of sprites.
