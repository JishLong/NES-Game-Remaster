CollisionManager.cs

For the most part, I think the collision manager is as consolidated as can be. 
Methods/variables and their order are consistent (e.g. using only SideA for consistency to prevent confusion), 
which helps the readability of each Handler object and the massive [if-else] method.

Comments could help highlight the different handlers in the [if-else] method, but not too important/subjectively helpful.
