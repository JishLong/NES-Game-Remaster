The CollisionDelegator has very high cohesion (and coupling), but that is not
the focus of this code review.  We are here to review the readability of
the class.  The comment at the top of the file is helpful, but it is the only
comment in the file, which is unfortunate.  The class has a constructor and
one method.  The constructor is straightforward enough; it just calls the
constructors of the class fields.  The DelegateCollision method however is not
readable at all.  For one, there is no use of whitespace to make the file
less visually dense.  For two, there are lots of compound expressions within
the if-blocks, with no explanation.  For me, looking at a visually dense section
of code is rather challenging, simply because of my bad eyesight and I have to
squint to read the code, and it tends to just run together.  The code itself is
not very difficult to understand once thouroughly read.
