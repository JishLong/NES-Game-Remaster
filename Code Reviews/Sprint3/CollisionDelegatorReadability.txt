CollisionDelegator.cs
Author of .cs: Josh Long
Number of minutes: 15

This file is organized clearly, each seperate goal of the .cs is blocked out by purpose. First each handler is declared as private fields that directly 
correlate to the two items that are colliding. Next,the public CollisionDelegator() object initializes each private field to its 
associated collision handler. Both of these code blocks are easy to read, and each collision has only one line of code to declare its field, and one 
line of code to instanciate its handler. The final block of this file is a public void DelegateCollision method with the purpose of determining which two colidable 
objects are envolved in a collision then calls the correlating collision handler. This block is some what overwhelming with all the if statement branching but each
segment itself is easy to read.
