Josh Long - 10/22/22, Sprint 3, LevelLoader.cs - written by Hayden Gray

This is an interesting class, as it takes an approach on the fairly complex problem of loading in level data from outside files. However, the way the class is set up is actually very simple and makes the overall task seem like a cakewalk.

Each subtask of level loading is split into their own methods, making them very easy to read and understand. There is essentially a method for the level as a whole, which calls a method for a room, which calls methods for the characters, items, and blocks. These last 3 methods are where the bulk of the work is done, and each step of the process is written out clearly and is quite easy to follow, despite completing one of the more complex tasks of the game thus far.

Overall, this class is very readable for what it tries to accomplish.
