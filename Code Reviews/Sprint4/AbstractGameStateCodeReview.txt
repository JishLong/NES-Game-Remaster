Comments: This class functions as an abstract for the game states, these states are used to control if the game is paused or in the menu or being played.
This class is very flexible and does it's job very well because it isn't very restrictive. It has good cohesion and pretty high coupling but this is necessary as it is such a core
part of the games functionality. The code is very reuseable.
