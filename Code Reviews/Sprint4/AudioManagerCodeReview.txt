Class under review: AudioManager.cs

As far as cohesion is concerned, this class is excellent. It deals only with playing, pausing 
and manipulating the state of audio in the game. Each method is named clearly which made this class
easy to use. As far as reusability goes, this class can be used anytime there is a sound effect, song or
other audio cue that needs to be played in the game. This makes the class extremely reusable.
