Sprint:
Name of the .cs: BladeTrap.cs
Author of the .cs: Hanebal Aseged
Several methods such as RespondToBladeTrap and RespondToWall have no paramaters, which provides ease to the client side code and reduces coupling. The 
naming conventions could be worked on to increase future readibility and potentially maintainability. The draw function makes good use of Utils singleton
constants inorder to avoid magic numbers. Short informative comments help readibility for other implimenters. 

One hypothetical suggestion would be to add more traps and add a variance to the frequency of attacks. This could make for a fun bonus level for Sprint 5 
where the user must avoid constantly attacking enemies who are in hot pursuit of the user.
