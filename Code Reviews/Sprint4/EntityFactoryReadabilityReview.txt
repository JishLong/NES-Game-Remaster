Comments:This class is pretty straightforward in what it does. It gives a quick explanation showing that it creates
and returns an entity. The paramaters are clearly labeled and it's easy to see how this class takes an input of strings
and retrieves the correct and places the correct item in the correct room whether this item is a block, character, or an actual item.
Everything is clearly labeled and oragnized which makes it easy to understand in how it works into the grand scheme of the code.
