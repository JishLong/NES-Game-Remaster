It is clear to read that this game state impliments the abstract game state. It is evident that depending on which item is selected, this class creates the 
appropriate sprite vector, and when selected the draw method displays the correct associating sprite on the screen. This class is clear in intention because 
of well thought out variable names and the cohesion of similar typing, such as all vector declarations in one location and item condition checks in another location.
