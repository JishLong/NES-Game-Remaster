Comments: The class has both high coupling and low cohesion.  It manages controllers, gets random tips,
and manages the current tip.  This makes the class complex and hard to refactor.  If, say, we wanted
to add image-based tips instead, we would have to make changes all throughout the class.  A better approach
may be to have a TipManager class to deal with all things tips and return a tip object.
