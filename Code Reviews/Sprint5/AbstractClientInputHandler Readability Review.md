Josh Long - 12/7/22, Sprint 5 - AbstractClientInputHandler.cs - written by Ethan Powers - time taken to write: 8 minutes

I'd like to start off by saying that this class deals with a topic that I'm fairly clueless on, which is that of multiplayer input handling. I barely have any idea how multiplayer or networking elements work at all, nevermind how to handle user input in a simplistic way.

With that being said, this class is so readable to the point where someone like me with no experience in multiplayer development is capable of understanding the gist of what the code aims to accomplish. Everything is nicely formatted and ordered, and methods are separated quite nicely with descriptive names. My favorite part of this piece of code, however, is the comments that are neatly scattered around the code. I'm a big fan of commenting code, and this is one of the circumstances that best shows why. Since I know nothing about the subject area this code deals with, these comments greatly enhance my understanding of the code.

Overall, this class has great readability from my point of view. I also suspect it has fairly good maintainability as well, as it's cohesiveness can be seen with just a glance at the class.
