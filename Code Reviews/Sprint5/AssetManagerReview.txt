Class under review: AssetManager.cs
Class author: Josh Long 

This class allows many different 'asset packs' to be loaded in 
at runtime, which in turn allow for dynamic switching between them.
This class is highly reusable and extensible given that the number of 
asset packs it can support is virtually unlimited. It is also very cohesive.
It has only a very few specific jobs that are closely linked to one another.
