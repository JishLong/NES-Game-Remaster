Comments: In terms of code quality, I think this class is really good.  It has one purpose, giving it high cohesion.
Though it has high coupling, I don't think that's a bad thing in this case.  The class
is relatively simple in it's logic, and it is written in a very natural way.  If a change were to be made to
allow for new command handlers, it would be easy to add them to this file, adding very little extra
complexity.
