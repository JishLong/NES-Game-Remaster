CommandParser.cs

Minutes: 7

The command parser takes in a command and returns the corrseponding parsed Command,
which the revlavent CommandLine Handler can then take care of. The fields as well as
the parse command are easily readable, and the switch case deals with all possible inputs
directly. The functionality of the class is complete and very simple.
