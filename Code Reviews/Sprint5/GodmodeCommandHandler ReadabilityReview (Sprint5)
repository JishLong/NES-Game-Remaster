It is clear that all inputs into the command line are stored into a list of Strings 
and are split to account for any user error when entering in the commands. It is readable both
cases of when the user wants to turn on and turn off the “Godmode” by checking the first word of the 
String list, Words. It is easy to tell what the key words Enable and Disable are intended for and what to do 
following once they are entered. Finally the catch case at the end of the file is easily readable to output an incorrect 
command if something other than Enable or Disable are entered on the command line.
