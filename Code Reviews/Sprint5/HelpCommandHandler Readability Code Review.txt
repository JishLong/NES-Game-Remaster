Comments: In terms of readability, this file is not very readable.  There are 
sparse comments throughout the code, but they don't add much to the overall 
readability of the code.  There is only one method inside the class and it is 
about 70 lines long.  There is considerable nesting within the method.  This 
could really use some refactoring.
