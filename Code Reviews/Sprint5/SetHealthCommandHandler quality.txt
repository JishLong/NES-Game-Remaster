The file is well organized and covers all of it's bases in functionality as none of the edge
cases that I can think of don't cause it any issues. Comprised of mostly if checks to make 
sure that nothing will break. It is a little clunky to scroll through but there isn't much that can be done
about this as their are many unique cases that it must be ready to handle.
Hypothetical, if we wanted to expand the set health command to set the health of any character not just
the player it would be able to handle that implementation without issues.
