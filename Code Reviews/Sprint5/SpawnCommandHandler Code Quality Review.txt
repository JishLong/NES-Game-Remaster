Comments: Though the coupling is very manageable in this class, the cohesion is 
very low.  There is one method in the class, and it's about 150 lines long.
It's responsibilities include validating each of the parameters.  If we wanted to 
expand the types of game objects that can be spawned, it would be quite 
challenging to integrate into this class.
