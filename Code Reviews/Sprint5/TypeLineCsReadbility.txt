The class has many functions, but comments help detail individual functions that aren't so obvious.
Same with fields, as there are many that are necessary for the class, and the comments help document
the purpose for each of them. If we had more time, we could continue to further abstract functions 
in the class, such as setting the cursor/text positions. Otherwise, the class is very readable and 
concise in functonality.
