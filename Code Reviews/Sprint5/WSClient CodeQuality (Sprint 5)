Code Quality: The organization of this file is organized cleanly by each block of related functions.
This file utilizes two outside packages, Newtonsoft.Json and Websocket.Client This makes for a looser coupling 
because of reference to outside packages. The next section of the file separates all declarations of private variables 
and constants. Keeping all related objects together is a strong example of tight cohesion. Each line of code follows the
practice of maintaining a sole purpose which improves readability and reusability which is a positive.  

Hypothetical: With multiple potential connections to the same server that the game is run through, it would not be too 
difficult to create split screen capabilities for multiple devices to run on.
