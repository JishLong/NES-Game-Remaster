# CSE-3902-Project - Sprint 3

This README file contains brief instructions/information regarding this project as well as its documentative efforts.

Firstly, here is a quick and explicit review of the game controls:

- Arrows, WASD: movement of Link
- Z, N: sword attack
- 1: normal arrow attack
- 2: blue arrow attack
- 3: boomerang attack
- 4: flame attack
- 5: bomb attack
- E: become damaged

- Left Click: teleport to previous room
- Right Click: teleport to next room
- The 7, 8, 9, and 0 keys also teleport you to rooms direction-wise (if you happen to know the map)

- Q: quit the game

Additionally, here are some extra features that might be hard to miss:
- Link's sword attack (Z, N) will create a projectile if he hasn't yet been damaged
- The boomerangs for both Link and the Goriyas will home back to the user, and are able to bounce off blocks indefinitely

As of writing this document, no known major bugs have been found during playtesting. However, seeing as this is a work-in-progress, this does not guarantee the absence of bugs. There are some small bugs involving collision with blocks - sometimes Link can get stuck in blocks due to a knockback mechanic that is not yet fully implemented. Boomerangs can also get into blocks on their way back to their user. Both of these minor issues will be fixed in the near future.

Finally, here are the various ways in which the development of this project has been documented:

- Task tracking (on GitHub) - below is a link to a GitHub page which contains all the tasks that the team was assigned for Sprint 3. There are also screenshots of the task board at different dates during the sprint - these can all be found in the Documentation folder.

- Code metrics analysis - the code metrics the Sprint3 solution were calculated using Visual Studio's analyze menu. This was done at various dates during the sprint - pictures of the displayed results can be found in the Documentation folder.

- Code reviews - various code reviews with focuses on code readability and maintainability can be found in the Code Reviews folder.

- Final reflection - a small discussion on the team's overall performance, including notable strengths and weaknesses, can be found in the Reflections folder. In this report, the team discusses the developmental process for this project, considers what worked versus what didn't, and gives thoughts on development for future sprints.
