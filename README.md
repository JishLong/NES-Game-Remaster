# CSE-3902-Project - Sprint 4 Functionality Check-in

This README file contains brief instructions/information regarding controls, features, and special cases for this project

Firstly, here is a quick list of the (main) game controls - these may vary from point to point in the game:

- Arrows, WASD: movement of Link
- Z, N: sword attack
- 1: normal arrow attack
- 2: blue arrow attack
- 3: boomerang attack
- 4: flame attack
- 5: bomb attack
- E: open inventory
- ESC: pause game
- M: mute audio
- Q: quit the game (can only be done when game is paused)
- SPACE: restarts the game (while on certain menu screens)

- Left Click: teleport to previous room
- Right Click: teleport to next room

Here are some explicit features that have not yet been implemented, but are planned to be implemented before the Sprint 4 due date:
- Different kinds of doors (locked, blocked, bomb)
- Finished inventory
- Map/minimap functionality
- Blade trap behavior
- Correct Wallmaster behavior
- Text in the "old man" room
- Clock "power up" functionality
- Link is still able to use whatever weapon he wants, whenever he wants (he's all-powerful)

Here are some of the "main" Sprint 4 requirements that have been so far implemented
- Mouse controls to teleport between rooms (for testing)
- Room with all items (for testing) - located in the room directly to the left of spawn :)
- Sound effects and background music, with mute functionality
- Resetting the level upon character's death
- (partial) HUD
- All possible game states and transitions (and bonus main menu with super helpful game tips)

Additionally, here are some other cool features (literally no one asked, who tf cares) that might be hard to miss:
- Link's sword attack (Z, N) will create a projectile if he is at full health (for now, is also spammable :) )
- The boomerangs for both Link and the Goriyas will home back to the user, and Link's can stun enemies and pick up items
- Link can actually die from his own bombs (how sad)
- Super epic transitions for going to basement room and winning game (not very epic)
- Effect when picking up a bow looks cool (it's not cool)
- Enemies drop items upon death
- Pause and mute buttons will even work during camera transitions!
