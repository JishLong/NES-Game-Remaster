This README file contains brief instructions/information regarding this project as well as its documentative efforts.

Firstly, here is a quick and explicit review of the game controls:

- Z, N: sword attack
- E: become damaged

- T, Y: cycle between items
- U, I: cycle between blocks
- O, P: cycle between enemies, bosses, and NPCs

As of writing this document, no known bugs have been found during playtesting. However, seeing as this is a work-in-progress, this does not guarantee the absence of bugs.
