# Sprint 2 Reflection

This document contains a short discussion on the team's development process - most notably, the strengths and weaknesses seen during the course of the sprint, as well as plans, strategies, and changes for future development.

## The Process:

Much of the team's work was split amongst different members proportionally. Josh was assigned implementation of the items, Hanebal that of the blocks, Hayden that of the enemies, and Alfie the bosses and friendly NPCs. Ethan and Paul jointly worked on the implementation of the player (Link), as it was determined to take a disproportionately higher amount of work.

Many team members worked at different times and rates, so GitHub was utilized as a central repository for the sharing of code. It was also decided that one team meeting was to occur each week as a means of checking in with each member and establishing plans for the next week of development.

## Strengths:

- Everyone was usually able to attend team meetings, so plans for development were always straightforward.
- GitHub worked quite well as a means of sharing code.
- The task tracking board on GitHub served as a nice reminder of what each member was assigned to complete.

## Weaknesses:

- There were various challenges regarding pulling code from the repository into Visual Studio. Among these challenges included fault gitignores and faulty Content folders. Although these problems were solved in due time, they posed a significant threat to the team's time and energy at the beginning of the sprint.
- Sometimes many team members were forgetful in terms of pulling/committing code to the central repository. As a result, there were some nasty merge conflicts at times - this is something that the team would definitely benefit from improving upon.
- Early project documentation was sparse; although documentation certainly picked up as time went on during the sprint, the missing documentation from the earliest days of development would be both interesting and useful to have.

## Future Development:

For future sprints, the team will definitely continue to evenly divide tasks among members to facilitate fair and efficient development. A task tracking board will also still be used, although a different service may be considered for future sprints. As opposed to this sprint, future sprints will see the team put forth a great effort to document progress as early on as possible.
