# Sprint 3 Reflection

This document contains a short discussion on the team's development process - most notably, the strengths and weaknesses seen during the course of the sprint, as well as plans, strategies, and changes for future development.

## The Process:

Much of the team's work was split amongst different members proportionally. Josh, Ethan, Paul, and Alfie were assigned the implementation of the collision system while Hayden and Hanebal were left to deal with the level loading system. This system was decided during a team meeting at the beginning of the sprint.

Many team members worked at different times and rates, so GitHub was utilized as a central repository for the sharing of code. This repository saw many new commits and merges during the full course of the sprint.

## Strengths:

- There was much improved GitHub usage compared to last sprint - there were way less conflict issues overall and team members utilized pull requests much more frequently.
- Project documentation saw much more light compared to last sprint. The documentation spans the entirety of the sprint as opposed to last sprint.
- The task tracking board on GitHub served as a nice reminder of what each member was assigned to complete.

## Weaknesses:

- There were various challenges regarding implementation of some of the complex systems, such as collision and level loading. However, everything was figured out in the end.
- Team members struggled somewhat with procrastination towards the functionality due date. However, there wasn't much of a rush for the actual deadline, which is a good thing.

## Future Development:

For future sprints, the team will definitely continue to evenly divide tasks among members to facilitate fair and efficient development. A task tracking board will also still be used on GitHub. The team will also continue to document the project progress from early on.
