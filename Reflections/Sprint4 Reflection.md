# Sprint 4 Reflection

This document contains a short discussion on the team's development process - most notably, the strengths and weaknesses seen during the course of the sprint, as well as plans, strategies, and changes for future development.

## The Process:

As opposed to sprints 2 and 3, tasks weren't split up very explicitly this time around. A few factors contributed to this - one of the most obvious ones is that many group members were feeling pressure from exams or even coming down with seasonal illnesses. However, another contributing factor was that there were more specific/involved tasks to complete whilst there were less tasks overall. This made it much more difficult to divide work evenly among group members. Although tasks weren't split up quite as evenly as the group would have liked, certain people still hovered around specific areas of development. Josh worked on much of the gamestate logic and audio framework, while Hayden worked a lot on door logic and room linking. Additionally, Paul did a lot of work on the inventory system and Hanebal worked on some advanced enemy logic. Ethan and Alfie worked with various other tasks and bugs around different parts of the code.

Just as with previous sprints, GitHub was utilized as a central repository for the sharing of code. This repository saw many new commits and merges during the full course of the sprint. Additionally, communication among group members in-person and via text message was quite frequent, with idea sharing between different people being a very helpful contributing factor to rapid and robust development.

## Strengths:

- As has been a trend with each sprint, the team's overall GitHub proficiency saw drastic improvements. Whereas sprint 2 saw lots of burdening merge conflicts and sprint 3 even saw a few as well, work during this sprint saw very little, if any complicated merge conflicts. Overall, members have become extremely proficient in dealing with merge conflicts, and have even become great at preventing them as well.
- Project documentation was quite frequent and greatly helped with identifying procrastination attempts and deciding when refactoring was needed.
- There were no "rushed deadlines" for either the functionality check-in or the actual sprint due date this time around - many core features were implemented at a comfortable time before they were due. This is a massive step up from sprint 3, and especially from sprint 2.
- The task tracking board on GitHub served as a very useful reminder for remaining features and bugs that had to be tackled. This is quite important due to the broad scope of sprint 4.

## Weaknesses:

- All team members struggled quite a bit during the beginning stages of implementing some of the more complex game mechanics. These include the camera transition logic, the door logic, and some of the more complicated enemy behaviors, with notable ones being the wallmasters and blade traps.
- Although the project documentation during this sprint was both frequent and helpful, it was slightly less frequent than in sprint 3. This is a slight oversight, and can be potentially improved upon during sprint 5 by documenting the code and task boards just a bit more frequently.

## Future Development:

For sprint 5, many team members each have their own fun ideas they'd like to pursue. Although not everyone is set in stone with what the team should implement, some ideas that have been considered (and thus have the greatest chance of being added) are:
- Resizable game window
- Multiplayer
- Gamepad input functionality
- Goomba easter egg - an entire new set of player logic complete with its own sprites, sounds, and attacks
- Extra items and enemies from the original Legend of Zelda game that are outside the scope of the dungeon

When deciding on what features to implement for sprint 5, the team will also attempt to evenly divide work to the best of its ability in order to facilitate fair and efficient development. This will still be done via a task board on GitHub. The team will also continue to document the project progress from early on.
