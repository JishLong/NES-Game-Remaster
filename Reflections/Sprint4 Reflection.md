# Sprint 4 Reflection

This document contains a short discussion on the team's development process - most notably, the strengths and weaknesses seen during the course of the sprint, as well as plans, strategies, and changes for future development.

## The Process:

As opposed to sprints 2 and 3, tasks weren't split up very explicitly this time around. A few factors contributed to this - one of the most obvious ones is that many group members were feeling pressure from exams or even coming down with seasonal illnesses. However, another contributing factor was that there were more specific/involved tasks to complete whilst there were less tasks overall. This made it much more difficult to divide work evenly among group members. Although tasks weren't split up quite as evenly as the group would have liked, certain people still hovered around specific areas of development. Josh worked on much of the gamestate logic and audio framework, while Hayden worked a lot on door logic and room linking. Additionally, Paul did a lot of work on the inventory system and Hanebal worked on some advanced enemy logic. Ethan and Alfie worked with various other tasks and bugs around different parts of the code.

Many team members worked at different times and rates, so GitHub was utilized as a central repository for the sharing of code. This repository saw many new commits and merges during the full course of the sprint.

## Strengths:

- There was much improved GitHub usage compared to last sprint - there were way less conflict issues overall and team members utilized pull requests much more frequently.
- Project documentation saw much more light compared to last sprint. The documentation spans the entirety of the sprint as opposed to last sprint.
- The task tracking board on GitHub served as a nice reminder of what each member was assigned to complete.

## Weaknesses:

- There were various challenges regarding implementation of some of the complex systems, such as collision and level loading. However, everything was figured out in the end.
- Team members struggled somewhat with procrastination towards the functionality due date. However, there wasn't much of a rush for the actual deadline, which is a good thing.

## Future Development:

For future sprints, the team will definitely continue to evenly divide tasks among members to facilitate fair and efficient development. A task tracking board will also still be used on GitHub. The team will also continue to document the project progress from early on.
