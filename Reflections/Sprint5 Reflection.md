# Sprint 5 Reflection

This document contains a short discussion on the team's development process - most notably, the strengths and weaknesses seen during the course of the sprint, as well as plans, strategies, and changes we would implement if the team were to continue development in the future.

## The Process:

Similarly to sprint 4, tasks weren't explicitly assigned to any one person - rather, the team had a "brainstorm" session for potential new features that could be added into the game that anyone could pick up and work on as they pleased. With this in mind, everyone tended to hover around different areas of development which will be noted here for documentation purposes. Paul, Hanebal, and Alfie worked on general polishing and completeness of the base game to ensure the team had fully implemented features from the original Zelda game to the greatest extent possible. Ethan spent the vast majority of the sprint carefully developing the multiplayer functionality and networking side of the game. Josh worked with the command line and "gamemode" functionality. Finally, Hayden worked on development of a second level that contained new blocks, enemies, and rooms.

Just as with previous sprints, GitHub was utilized as a central repository for the sharing of code. This repository saw many new commits and merges during the full course of the sprint. Additionally, communication among group members in-person and via text message was quite frequent, with idea sharing between different people being a very helpful contributing factor to rapid and robust development.

## Strengths:

- GitHub pull requests were frequent and led to virtually no merge conflicts
- Despite the team having many people and not that much left to implement, everyone was able to find something to work on that they enjoyed
- Project documentation was quite frequent and greatly helped with identifying procrastination attempts and deciding when refactoring was needed.
- There was no pressure at all for deadlines. Compared to every sprint before this, the development for this sprint felt much easier and less stressful overall
- The task tracking board on GitHub served as a superb brainstorming area as well as a good way to let others know what tasks had been "nabbed" so far by other team members

## Weaknesses:

- Much time was wasted in some cases during attempts to implement some features due to a failure to think ahead. For example, in making the window resizable, a decent portion of code was first refactored and later changed back after it was discovered to have been unnecessary. Although examples like this didn't have huge impacts on the project as a whole, they definitely entail setbacks that were frustrating at some times
- Project documentation could have been slightly more frequent, although in this regard there were fewer times when major changes to the codebase were made

## Future Development:

Although development for this prooject has reached its end, there are definitely extra things that could have been implemented had the team had the time to do so. In fact, the final state of the GitHub taskboard, as can be seen in the Documentation folder, has some additional ideas that were never implemented. These ideas include a shop to buy items, implementation of both existing (unused) and additional items, enemies, and blocks into the game, and better AI for the enemies. Although the team is happy with what was accomplished during this development period, some of these extra ideas would have been nice to see with more time.
