# Sprint 5 Reflection

This document contains a short discussion on the team's development process - most notably, the strengths and weaknesses seen during the course of the sprint, as well as plans, strategies, and changes we would implement if the team were to continue development in the future.

## The Process:

Similarly to sprint 4, tasks weren't explicitly assigned to any one person - rather, the team had a "brainstorm" session for potential new features that could be added into the game that anyone could pick up and work on as they pleased. With this in mind, everyone tended to hover around different areas of development which will be noted here for documentation purposes. Paul, Hanebal, and Alfie worked on general polishing and completeness of the base game to ensure the team had fully implemented features from the original Zelda game to the greatest extent possible. Ethan spent the vast majority of the sprint carefully developing the multiplayer functionality and networking side of the game. Josh worked with the command line and "gamemode" functionality. Finally, Hayden worked on development of a second level that contained new blocks, enemies, and rooms.

Just as with previous sprints, GitHub was utilized as a central repository for the sharing of code. This repository saw many new commits and merges during the full course of the sprint. Additionally, communication among group members in-person and via text message was quite frequent, with idea sharing between different people being a very helpful contributing factor to rapid and robust development.

## Strengths:

- As has been a trend with each sprint, the team's overall GitHub proficiency saw drastic improvements. Whereas sprint 2 saw lots of burdening merge conflicts and sprint 3 even saw a few as well, work during this sprint saw very little, if any complicated merge conflicts. Overall, members have become extremely proficient in dealing with merge conflicts, and have even become great at preventing them as well.
- Project documentation was quite frequent and greatly helped with identifying procrastination attempts and deciding when refactoring was needed.
- There were no "rushed deadlines" for either the functionality check-in or the actual sprint due date this time around - many core features were implemented at a comfortable time before they were due. This is a massive step up from sprint 3, and especially from sprint 2.
- The task tracking board on GitHub served as a very useful reminder for remaining features and bugs that had to be tackled. This is quite important due to the broad scope of sprint 4.

## Weaknesses:

- All team members struggled quite a bit during the beginning stages of implementing some of the more complex game mechanics. These include the camera transition logic, the door logic, and some of the more complicated enemy behaviors, with notable ones being the wallmasters and blade traps.
- Although the project documentation during this sprint was both frequent and helpful, it was slightly less frequent than in sprint 3. This is a slight oversight, and can be potentially improved upon during sprint 5 by documenting the code and task boards just a bit more frequently.

## Future Development:

For sprint 5, many team members each have their own fun ideas they'd like to pursue. Although not everyone is set in stone with what the team should implement, some ideas that have been considered (and thus have the greatest chance of being added) are:
- Resizable game window
- Multiplayer
- Gamepad input functionality
- Goomba easter egg - an entire new set of player logic complete with its own sprites, sounds, and attacks
- Extra items and enemies from the original Legend of Zelda game that are outside the scope of the dungeon

When deciding on what features to implement for sprint 5, the team will also attempt to evenly divide work to the best of its ability in order to facilitate fair and efficient development. This will still be done via a task board on GitHub. The team will also continue to document the project progress from early on.
