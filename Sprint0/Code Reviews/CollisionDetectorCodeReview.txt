Sprint #: 3
Name of .cs file: CollisionDetector.cs
Author of .cs file: Josh Long

The code in this file has both high coupling and only moderate cohesion.
Currently, the CollisionController calls the Update() maethod on it to handle
all collision logic.  Though there are other collision classes, they are only
ever used by the CollisionDetector.  To decrease coupling, we should use the
collisionDetector class as the first in a pipeline of collision classes, called
from the CollisionController's Update() method.  This would reduce coupling and
increase coheision in the CollisionDetector class.
