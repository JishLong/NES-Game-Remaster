Comments: Although the class is not visually appealing, since whitespace is not well utilized,
much of the code is quite self-explanatory so it is still quite readable.  Furthermore,
comments are sparsed in with the code, further enhancing readability. My only complaint
is that the variable capitalization seems to be inconsistent throughout the class, which is
a pet-peeve of mine.
